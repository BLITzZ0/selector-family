# Selector-Family Recoil

This program demonstrates how to use Recoil’s `atomFamily` and `selectorFamily` together with `useRecoilStateLoadable` to dynamically fetch and display todo data in a React application. The key goal here is to fetch todo items from an external API based on their ID and handle the loading and error states gracefully.

At the heart of the state management is the `todosFamily`, which is an `atomFamily`. An atom family allows you to create a set of atoms that are parameterized—in this case, by a todo ID. Instead of defining a separate atom for each todo item, you can use `todosFamily(id)` to create or retrieve the atom for a specific todo. The default value for each atom in this family is defined using a `selectorFamily`.

The `selectorFamily` is responsible for fetching the data. It takes an ID as input and returns an asynchronous function that makes an API call to fetch the todo item with that ID. It also introduces an artificial 5-second delay using `setTimeout` to simulate latency. When the selector completes its data fetching, it returns the result, which then becomes the default value of the corresponding atom in the atom family.

In the component `MainApp`, the program uses `useRecoilStateLoadable` with `todosFamily(id)`. This hook gives a `Loadable` object instead of throwing an error or suspending the component while the data is loading. The Loadable object includes the current state (`"loading"`, `"hasValue"`, or `"hasError"`) and the result or error. This approach allows the component to explicitly render different UI depending on the state—such as showing a loading message, displaying the data, or handling errors—without relying on React’s `Suspense`.

Altogether, this architecture offers a powerful and flexible way to fetch and manage asynchronous state in React using Recoil. It ensures that each todo is fetched only when needed, and the UI remains responsive and clear about the data-fetching process.
